## Microsoft Edge (Stable, Beta, Dev, or Canary) Portable with Chrome++ Auto Installer

No installation or setup required. Keeps all history, cookies, extensions, and settings even when moved to another device.

**Script features:**

* Downloads the latest Edge Stable, Beta, Dev, or Canary x64 from [edge_installer_multi](https://github.com/bibicadotnet/edge_installer_multi/releases)
* Integrates [Chrome++](https://github.com/Bush2021/chrome_plus) for extra features

**Download the pre-built [release](https://github.com/bibicadotnet/microsoft-edge-multi-portable/releases)**, extract, and start using immediately.

### ⚠ Virus warning?

Due to the way Microsoft Edge is bypassed to run as a portable app, Microsoft Defender Antivirus may falsely flag it as a trojan.

If this happens, allow/whitelist the file and wait for Microsoft Defender’s definitions to update and remove the false positive.
